# 📐 Diode Clippers and Clampers Simulation using eSIM

## 🎯 Overview
This project involves the simulation and analysis of diode-based **clipper** and **clamper** circuits using the open-source software **eSIM**, developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay. These fundamental nonlinear circuits are essential for **waveform shaping** in analog signal processing and communication systems.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- **Clippers (Limiters):** Circuits that remove portions of the waveform beyond a defined voltage level.
- **Clampers:** Circuits that shift the entire waveform to a different DC level without altering its shape.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Simulate common diode-based clippers and clampers in eSIM.
- Analyze the waveform transformation effects.
- Demonstrate applications in communication, signal modulation, and noise reduction.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **eSIM (Electronic Simulation Integrated Module)** — an open-source circuit simulation tool developed by [FOSSEE](https://esim.fossee.in/), IIT Bombay.

## ⚙️ Circuit Types Simulated

### Clippers:
- Positive Clipper
- Negative Clipper
- Biased Clippers

### Clampers:
- Positive Clamper
- Negative Clamper

Each circuit includes schematics and waveform output screenshots.

## 🧪 Simulation Procedure
1. Open **eSIM** and start a new project.
2. Build circuits using diodes, resistors, capacitors, and signal generators.
3. Set a **1 kHz sine wave input** with **5V amplitude**.
4. Run the simulation and observe output waveforms on the virtual oscilloscope.
5. Record and analyze waveform behavior.

## ✅ Results
- Clear demonstration of clipping at desired voltage levels.
- Verified DC level shifting using clamper circuits.
- Visual comparison of input vs output confirmed theoretical understanding.
